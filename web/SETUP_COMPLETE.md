## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### Form Submission Logic:

#### Google Sheets Method:

1. User fills form and selects "Google Sheets"
2. Data is sent via POST request to Google Apps Script
3. Apps Script saves data to the spreadsheet
4. Success toast notification appears
5. Form automatically resets

#### WhatsApp Method:

1. User fills form and selects "WhatsApp"
2. WhatsApp opens with pre-filled message
3. User can send message directly
4. Form automatically resets

### CORS Handling:

- Uses `mode: 'no-cors'` to avoid CORS preflight issues
- Uses `Content-Type: text/plain` to prevent browser blocking
- Success determined by request completion, not response reading
